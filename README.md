<p align="center"> A imaginary veterinary clinic website project, the first project that I made for a course by OneBitCode </p>

## Introduction

![Home page of PetLife's website project](/PetLife-project-image.png)

This was the very first time that I actually use vscode and studied the basic of html, css and javascript. With this project I could know what's the meaning and use of these main technologies. To me, the project means how I got into web development and the begining of it all. So that's why I wanna share it here, and surely, for showing a bit of my knowledge and skills.

### Technologies

<ul>
<li> HTML5 -> To create the structure of the website. </li>
<li> CSS3 -> To make the style design of this structure. </li>
<li> Javascript -> To create this visual effect as you can see in the image above. </li>
</ul>
